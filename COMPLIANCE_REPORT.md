### ⚠️ Partially Implemented (40-85% complete)  
- Extension management operations
- Profile management operations
- UI/UX specifications
- Error handling

### ❌ Not Implemented (0-40% complete)
- Launch script integration
- Profile quick switch (Ctrl+P)
- Command palette (Ctrl+K)
- Extension validation against schema
- Profile inheritance
- Auto-detection rules
- Backup functionality

## Detailed Analysis by Component

### 1. Extension Management

#### ✅ Correctly Implemented:
- **Extension Discovery**: `Scan()` function properly discovers extensions in `~/.gemini/extensions/`
- **Data Structure**: Extension type matches spec with all required fields
- **Basic Operations**: Enable/disable functionality works correctly
- **Status Tracking**: Proper status states (Active, Disabled, etc.)

#### ⚠️ Partially Implemented:
- **Extension Validation**: `Validator` exists but doesn't validate against JSON schema
- **MCP Server Management**: Structure defined but no process management
- **Extension Loading**: `Loader` exists but doesn't actually start MCP servers
- **Remove Operation**: Moves to trash as specified but `.trash` directory handling incomplete

#### ❌ Not Implemented:
- **Install from Git/URL**: `Install()` returns "not yet implemented"
- **Update Extensions**: `Update()` returns "not yet implemented"  
- **Dependency Resolution**: No dependency checking between extensions
- **Health Monitoring**: No MCP server health checks
- **Extension Categories**: Categories field exists but not used for filtering/search

### 2. Profile Management

#### ✅ Correctly Implemented:
- **Profile Structure**: Matches spec exactly with YAML storage
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete all functional
- **Default Profile**: Automatically created and protected from deletion
- **Active Profile Tracking**: Properly tracks and persists active profile
- **Clone Functionality**: Deep copy implementation works correctly

#### ⚠️ Partially Implemented:
- **Profile Switching**: Basic switching works but missing quick switch (Ctrl+P)
- **Usage Tracking**: `LastUsed` and `UsageCount` tracked but not displayed
- **Profile Validation**: Basic validation but missing extension existence checks

#### ❌ Not Implemented:
- **Profile Inheritance**: `Inherits` field exists but not resolved
- **Auto-Detection**: `AutoDetect` structure defined but not functional
- **Profile Templates**: No built-in templates despite spec requirement
- **Import/Export**: No functionality for sharing profiles
- **Profile Backups**: No automatic backup system

### 3. User Interface

#### ✅ Correctly Implemented:
- **Layout Structure**: Sidebar + Content + Status bar matches spec
- **Navigation Model**: List/Detail split view works correctly
- **Key Bindings**: Basic navigation (arrows, vim keys) implemented
- **Color Scheme**: Clean, readable colors as specified
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus switching between panes

#### ⚠️ Partially Implemented:
- **Visual Design**: Missing icons and visual polish from spec
- **Help System**: Basic help view but missing contextual help
- **Error Display**: Shows errors in status bar but no modal dialogs
- **Loading States**: No loading indicators or progress bars

#### ❌ Not Implemented:
- **Command Palette**: Ctrl+K not implemented
- **Profile Quick Switch**: Ctrl+P not implemented
- **Search/Filter**: "/" key binding defined but not functional
- **Modal Dialogs**: No implementation for create/edit operations
- **Animations**: No transitions or loading animations

### 4. Launcher Integration

#### ❌ Completely Missing:
- No launch script created
- No integration with actual Gemini CLI
- Launch button in UI exists but doesn't function
- No environment variable setup for launches
- No profile auto-detection on launch

### 5. Security & Safety

#### ⚠️ Partially Implemented:
- **Safe Deletion**: Extensions moved to trash instead of deleted
- **Default Profile Protection**: Cannot delete default profile
- **Active Profile Protection**: Cannot delete active profile

#### ❌ Not Implemented:
- **Checksum Verification**: No integrity checking
- **Permission Warnings**: No security warnings
- **Credential Management**: No keychain integration
- **Sandboxing**: No isolation for extensions

### 6. Data Management

#### ✅ Correctly Implemented:
- **Directory Structure**: Proper `~/.gemini/` hierarchy
- **File Formats**: YAML for profiles, JSON for extensions

#### ❌ Not Implemented:
- **Backup Strategy**: No automatic backups
- **Cache Directory**: Not created or used
- **Logs Directory**: Not created or used
- **Version History**: No backup retention

## Phase 1 MVP Feature Checklist

Based on the product spec's Phase 1 requirements:

- [x] Basic extension listing and toggling
- [x] Simple profile creation and switching
- [ ] Launch script integration
- [x] File-based configuration
- [ ] Extension search/filtering
- [ ] Profile quick switch (Ctrl+P)
- [ ] Command palette (Ctrl+K)
- [ ] Basic validation and error handling
- [ ] Help documentation in UI

## Critical Missing Features for Phase 1

1. **Launch Integration**: The app cannot actually launch Gemini CLI
2. **Quick Actions**: No keyboard shortcuts for rapid profile/extension management
3. **Search Functionality**: Cannot search or filter extensions/profiles
4. **Form-based Editing**: All edit operations show "not yet implemented"
5. **Template System**: No profile templates for quick setup

## Recommendations for Phase 1 Completion

### High Priority (Required for MVP):
1. Implement launch script and Gemini CLI integration
2. Add profile quick switch (Ctrl+P) functionality
3. Implement search/filter for extensions
4. Create form dialogs for create/edit operations
5. Add basic profile templates

### Medium Priority (Enhance MVP):
1. Implement command palette (Ctrl+K)
2. Add loading indicators and progress feedback
3. Improve error handling with proper modals
4. Add contextual help system
5. Implement basic extension validation

### Low Priority (Can defer to Phase 2):
1. Git-based extension installation
2. Advanced security features
3. Backup and recovery system
4. Animation and transitions
5. Extension marketplace integration

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths:
- Clean separation of concerns (CLI, Extension, Profile packages)
- Proper use of Go idioms and error handling
- Thread-safe operations with mutex protection
- Well-structured data types matching specifications

### Areas for Improvement:
- Many TODO comments indicating incomplete features
- Limited test coverage
- No logging or debugging infrastructure
- Missing documentation in code

## Conclusion

The Gemini CLI Manager has a solid foundation with approximately 65% of Phase 1 features implemented. The core architecture is sound, but critical functionality like launching Gemini CLI and quick profile switching must be completed before the MVP can be considered functional. The team should focus on completing the high-priority items listed above to achieve Phase 1 compliance.
