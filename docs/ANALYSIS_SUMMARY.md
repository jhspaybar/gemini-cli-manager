# Analysis Summary: Gemini CLI Manager

## Executive Summary

After thorough analysis of the official Gemini CLI documentation and our existing specifications, significant corrections are needed to align our implementation with how Gemini CLI actually works.

## Key Findings

### 1. ❌ Incorrect Assumptions in Original Specs

1. **Command-line arguments**: Gemini CLI does NOT accept configuration via CLI args
2. **Extension loading**: Extensions MUST be in workspace `.gemini/extensions/` directory
3. **File names**: Uses `gemini-extension.json` NOT `settings.json` for extensions
4. **Complexity**: Actual extensions are much simpler than our specs suggested
5. **Launch method**: Gemini is an interactive REPL, not a traditional CLI tool

### 2. ✅ Correct Understanding

1. **Gemini CLI** is an interactive REPL launched by simply running `gemini`
2. **Extensions** are loaded from:
   - Workspace: `<cwd>/.gemini/extensions/`
   - Home: `~/.gemini/extensions/`
3. **Configuration** via:
   - `gemini-extension.json` in each extension directory
   - `.gemini/settings.json` for overrides
   - `.env` files for environment variables
4. **MCP Servers** are the primary extension mechanism

### 3. ✅ Confirmed: Independent State Management

Our application correctly stores its own state in platform-specific directories:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/gemini-cli-manager/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/gemini-cli-manager/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\gemini-cli-manager\`

## Revised Core Workflow

```
Extension Library → Profile Configuration → Workspace Setup → Launch Gemini
```

### Detailed Flow:

1. **Maintain Extension Library**
   - Import existing extensions
   - Create new extensions
   - Store in app's data directory

2. **Define Profiles** (our concept)
   - Select extensions to include
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set workspace directory
   - Define settings overrides

3. **Activate Profile**
   - Create `.gemini/` structure in workspace
   - Copy selected extensions
   - Generate `settings.json`
   - Create `.env` file
   - Launch Gemini in workspace

## What Changes in Our Implementation

### Remove/Modify:
- ❌ Complex command-line argument building
- ❌ Global extension installation concepts
- ❌ Complex dependency resolution system
- ❌ Direct Gemini process management with flags

### Add/Focus:
- ✅ Workspace directory management
- ✅ Extension copying to workspaces
- ✅ Settings.json generation
- ✅ Environment file creation
- ✅ Profile as "workspace template"

## Updated Data Models

### Extension (Simplified)
```rust
pub struct GeminiExtension {
    pub name: String,
    pub version: String,
    pub mcp_servers: HashMap<String, McpServerConfig>,
    pub context_file_name: Option<String>,
}
```

### Profile (Workspace-Oriented)
```rust
pub struct Profile {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub workspace_dir: PathBuf,
    pub extensions: Vec<ProfileExtension>,
    pub env_vars: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub settings_overrides: Option<serde_json::Value>,
}
```

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1 (MVP)
1. Extension library management
2. Basic profile creation
3. Workspace setup functionality
4. Simple Gemini launch

### Phase 2
1. Extension search/discovery
2. Profile templates
3. Environment variable security
4. Quick switching

### Phase 3
1. Multi-workspace management
2. Team features
3. Extension development tools

## Benefits of Corrected Approach

1. **Works with Gemini's design** - No fighting against the tool
2. **Cleaner implementation** - Simpler than originally planned
3. **Better isolation** - Each profile gets its own workspace
4. **Team-friendly** - Easy to share workspace configurations
5. **Non-invasive** - Doesn't modify Gemini installation

## Next Steps

1. **Update specifications** to reflect correct understanding
2. **Simplify code** by removing unnecessary complexity
3. **Focus on workspace management** as core feature
4. **Create UI mockups** for new workflow
5. **Write tests** for workspace setup logic

## Summary

Our Gemini CLI Manager transforms from a "launcher with arguments" to a "workspace configuration manager" that:
- Maintains a library of extensions
- Allows profile-based workspace setups
- Manages environment configurations
- Launches Gemini in properly configured directories

This approach is simpler, more aligned with Gemini's architecture, and provides the profile-based workflow users want.
