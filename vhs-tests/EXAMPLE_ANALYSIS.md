# Example Test Analysis

This is an example of how to analyze VHS test results using the analysis instructions.

## Tab Navigation Test Results
**Date**: 2025-06-28
**Test File**: navigation/tabs
**Analyst**: Claude

### Overall Result: PASS ✅

### Navigation Methods Tested:
- Tab key: PASS ✅
- Arrow keys: PASS ✅
- Vim keys (h/l): PASS ✅

### Detailed Analysis

#### Step 1: Application Start (`tabs-01-start.png`)
**Status**: ✅ All checks passed
- [x] Application launches without errors
- [x] Tab bar is visible at the top with 4 tabs: Extensions, Profiles, Settings, Help
- [x] "Extensions" tab is highlighted/active (first tab)
- [x] Extensions content is displayed in the main area
- [x] Status bar is visible at the bottom
- [x] Search bar is visible
- [x] No error messages displayed
- [x] No rendering artifacts
- [x] All borders render completely

#### Step 2: Tab Key Navigation to Profiles (`tabs-02-profiles.png`)
**Status**: ✅ All checks passed
- [x] "Profiles" tab is now highlighted/active
- [x] "Extensions" tab is no longer highlighted
- [x] Content area shows profiles empty state
- [x] Tab bar remains stable (no flickering)

#### Step 3-9: Additional Navigation Steps
**Status**: ✅ All navigation methods work correctly
- Tab key cycles through all tabs and wraps correctly
- Arrow keys navigate as expected with proper wrapping
- Vim keys (h/l) work identically to arrow keys

### Issues Found:
None - all expected behaviors were met.

### Notes:
- The application correctly shows empty states when no data exists
- State directory path in Settings correctly shows `/tmp/vhs-nav-test`
- All three navigation methods produce identical results
- Visual design is consistent with theme

### Recommendations:
1. Test passes all criteria
2. Consider adding tests for:
   - Navigation with populated data
   - Navigation during loading states
   - Navigation with error states

## How This Analysis Was Done

1. **Reviewed the GIF**: Watched the full interaction to understand the flow
2. **Checked Each Screenshot**: Verified each checkpoint against the specification
3. **Validated Navigation**: Confirmed all three methods work identically
4. **Looked for Issues**: Checked for rendering problems, errors, or unexpected behavior
5. **Documented Results**: Used the template to report findings

This structured approach ensures thorough testing and clear reporting of results.
