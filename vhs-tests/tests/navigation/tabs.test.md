### Overall Pass Criteria

- [ ] Navigation wraps correctly at both ends
- [ ] Tab highlighting is clear and consistent
- [ ] Content updates match the selected tab
- [ ] No visual glitches or rendering errors

### Common Issues to Check
1. **Tab Bar Rendering**: Are all 4 tabs visible and properly spaced?
2. **Active Tab Indicator**: Is it clear which tab is selected?
3. **Content Switching**: Does content change immediately with tab selection?
4. **Wrap-around**: Does navigation wrap correctly at both ends?
5. **State Persistence**: Does the app maintain state when switching tabs?

### Error Reporting
If any issues are found:
1. Note the specific screenshot where the issue occurs
2. Describe what was expected vs what actually happened
3. Check if the issue is consistent across multiple navigation methods
4. Note any error messages or visual artifacts
